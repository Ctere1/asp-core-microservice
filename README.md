## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Introduction

This is a simple microservice project using ASP.NET Core 6.0. The project is based on the following article: [Microservices Architecture](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/microservice-using-asp-net-core/).

## Microservices Architecture

- A microservice is a software development technique that structures an application as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other through APIs. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific business function and can be deployed independently of the other services in the application.        

- The following picture from Microsoft Docs shows the microservices architecture style.

- There are various components in a microservices architecture apart from microservices themselves:     
    - <b>Management:</b>Maintains the configuration and operational data for the microservices.     
    - <b>API Gateway: </b>Provides a single entry point for clients to access all the microservices.     
    - <b>Service Discovery:</b> Maintains a list of all the microservices instances that are currently running.      
    - <b>Identity Provider:</b> Provides authentication and authorization for the microservices.     
    - <b>CDN:</b> Provides caching and content delivery services.        
    - <b>Static Content: </b>Provides static content to the clients.     

- Microservices are deployed independently with their own database per service so the underlying microservices look as shown in the following picture.

## Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture

- A monolithic application is a traditional software development approach where an application is built as a single, indivisible unit. All the components of the application are tightly coupled and run as a single process. Monolithic applications are typically large and complex, making them difficult to maintain and scale.

- Following is the diagrammatic representation of monolithic architecture being package completely or being service based.

- Microservice is an approach to create small services each running in their own space and can communicate via messaging. These are independent services directly calling their own database.
